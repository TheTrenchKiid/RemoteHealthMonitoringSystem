Remote Health Monitoring System

This project is a simple java program for a remote health monitoring system for Near East University Hospital

The system is about patients, doctors and wearable devices

Patients have a wearable device and the wearable device reads heart rate

The system checks if the heart rate is normal or not if it is not normal an alert is created

The doctor then reviews the alert

There are multiple java files

Patient.java stores patient info

Doctor.java is for doctor

Wearabledevice.java simulates the device

Vitalsign.java stores the vital data

Monitoringservice.java checks if values are abnormal

Alert.java stores alert message

Main.java runs everything

The Main.java class just creates objects and runs the flow

No real database No real network just simulation

To run it
Open in any java ide
Run Main.java

**IT IS NOT A REAL MEDICAL SYSTEM JUST FOR LEARNING PURPOSES**
